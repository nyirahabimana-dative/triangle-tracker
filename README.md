|  Behavior                          |  Input    | Output      | 
|------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| When I put in 3 equal numbers,     |           |             |                           | it will say that the triangle is   |    5, 5, 5|  Equilateral|
|  Equilateral                       |           |             |      
|------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| When I put in 2 equal numbers and  |           |             |
|the other one different from the two| 8, 8, 10  |  Isosceles  |         
|it will say that the triangle is    |           |             |
|isosceles                           |           |             |      
|------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|       
|When I put in 3 different numbers,  |           |             |             
|it will say that the triangle is    | 5, 7, 9   | scalene     |
|scalene                             |           |             |
|------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
|When I put in numbers where the sum |           | not a       |
|of two sides is less than the       |  0, 2, 3  |  triangle   |
|the remaining one or give the side a|           |             |
|number equal to 0 it will say that  |           |             |
|this is not a triangle              |           |             |
